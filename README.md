# weather-app
A small command line weather app which uses API calls to fetch weather details.
I have used axios to make the API calls.

To run ,simply clone the repo and run npm install in the cloned folder.

eg-
```
$ node app.js -a="gomti nagar lucknow"
Gomti Nagar, Lucknow, UP, India
It's currently 26.39. It feels like 32.80

$ node app.js -a="paris france"
Paris, ÃŽle-de-France, France
It's currently 9.00. It feels like 15.20
```
