# weather-app
A small command line weather app which uses API calls to fetch weather details.
I have used axios to make the API calls.

To run ,simply clone the repo and run npm install in the cloned folder.

Then type 'node app.js -a="{YOUR ADDRESS}" ' in the terminal to get the current and apparent temperature of the address you used.
